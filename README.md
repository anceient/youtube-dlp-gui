# youtube-dlp-gui
This is my own take on a gui for yt-dlp using dear pygui<br>
This includes both a version of yt-dlp and ffmpeg so neither have to be downloaded<br>
yt-dlp is auto updated when a video is downloaded<br>

note if your running/compiling from source you will need to download a version of ffmpeg.exe since i cannot put it on github
