# youtube-dlp-gui
This is my own take on a gui for yt-dlp using dear pygui<br>
This includes both a version of yt-dlp and ffmpeg so neither have to be downloaded<br>

note if your running/compiling from source you will need to unzip ffmpeg.7z in the exe folder since its too large to to put on github uncompressed
